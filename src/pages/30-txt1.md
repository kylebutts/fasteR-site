## <a name="txt1"> </a> Lesson 30:  Simple Text Processing, II

So, let's use our `extractNonemptyWords` function on our `abt` vector.
Here's a loop way to do it:

``` r
allWords <- NULL  # start with empty vector
for (i in 1:70) {
   thisLine <- extractNonemptyWords(abt[i])
   allWords <- c(allWords,thisLine)
}
```

Note that the result, i.e. the final value of `allWords`, will be one
long vector, consisting of all the words in the file.

As usual, it is a must to inspect the result, say the first 25 elements:

``` r
> head(allWords,25)
 [1] "What"         "is"           "R?"          
 [4] "Introduction" "to"           "R"           
 [7] "R"            "is"           "a"           
[10] "language"     "and"          "environment" 
[13] "for"          "statistical"  "computing"   
[16] "and"          "graphics."    "It"          
[19] "is"           "a"            "GNU"         
[22] "project"      "which"        "is"          
[25] "similar"     
```

Good, all the words seem to be there, and the `""` are NOT there, just as
desired.  But how to get the word counts?  Why, it's our old friend,
`tapply`!

``` r
> q <- tapply(allWords,allWords,length)
> head(q,25)
            ;            …) “environment”      (easily)     (formerly 
            1             1             1             1             1 
   (including       (linear             *             ©             a 
            1             1             5             1            13 
        about     accretion     activity.           add    additional 
            3             1             1             1             1 
     Advanced   algorithmic        allows            an      analysis 
            1             1             1             5             2 
    analysis,           and           are        around       arrays, 
            2            27             4             1             1 
```

Actually, this really the same pattern we saw before, with the
`length` function as our third argument.  It may look a little odd
that the first two arguments are identical, but it makes sense:

1.  We split up the `allWords` vector into piles, according to the
    second argument, which happens to be the same vector.

2.  We apply the `length` function to each pile, giving us the count
    in each pile, exactly what we needed.

</Tip>

We're not fully done yet.  For instance, we have a punctuation problem,
where periods, commas and so on are considered parts of words, such as
the period in `allWords[17]` seen above, 'graphics.'  We also probably
should change capital letters to lower  

For major usage, we should consider using one of the advanced R packages
in text processing.  For instance, the `tm` package has a
`removePunctuation` function.  But let's see how we can do this with
the basics.

We'll use R's `gsub` function.  It's call form, as we'll use it, is

``` r
gsub(string_to_change,replacement,input_vector,fixed=TRUE)
```

E.g.

``` r
> a <- c('abc','de.')
> gsub('.','',a,fixed=TRUE)  # replace '.' by empty stringW
[1] "abc" "de" 
```

(The **fixed** argument is complex, and pops up in all the R string
manipulation packages.  This again is something you should use for now,
and look into when you become more skilled at R.)

So, to remove all periods in `allWords`, we can do:

``` r
> awNoPers <- gsub('.','',allWords,fixed=TRUE) 
> awNoPers[17]  # check that it worked
[1] "graphics"
```

<!--
empty strings; empty lines; 'for' loop to get tot number of words;
fancier, Reduce()
-->
