## <a name="advanced"> </a> Lesson 26:  A Pause, Before Going on to Advanced Topics

At this point, you have a pretty good grounding in R.  You are capable
of doing lots of things in R.  It may be all you need, but even if not,
you know enough to ask a question online if you get stuck on something.

The remaining topics are more advanced, and lessons will be somewhat
longer and more detailed that the previous ones.  But you are still
strongly encouraged to go through them, as they will not only cover new
topics but also give you deeper insight into the earlier material.
