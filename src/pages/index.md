# fasteR: Fast Lane to Learning R!

## *"Becoming productive in R, as fast as possible"*

### Norm Matloff, Prof. of Computer Science, UC Davis; [my bio](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/matloff.html)

(See notice at the end of this document regarding copyright.)

This site is for those who know nothing of R, and maybe even nothing of
programming, and seek *QUICK, PAINLESS!* entree to the world of R.

* **FAST**:  You'll already be doing good stuff in R -- useful data analysis
-- in your very first lesson.

* **For nonprogrammers:**  If you're comfortable with navigating
the Web and viewing charts, you're fine.  This tutorial is aimed 
at you, not experienced C or Python coders.

* **Motivating:**  Every lesson centers around a *real problem* to be
solved, on *real data*.  The lessons do *not* consist of a few toy
examples, unrelated to the real world.  The material is presented in a
conversational, story-telling manner.

* **Just the basics, no frills or polemics:** 

    - Notably, in the first few lessons, we do NOT use Integrated
      Development Environments (IDEs).  RStudio, ESS etc. are great, but
you shouldn't be burdened with learning R *and* learning an IDE at the
same time, a distraction from the goal of becoming productive in R as
fast as possible.  

     Note that even the excellent course by [R-Ladies
Sydney](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1119025557830684673.html),
which does start with RStudio, laments that RStudio can be
**"way too overwhelming."**  

     So, in the initial lessons,  we stick to the R command line, and
focus on data analysis, not tools such as IDEs, which we will cover as
an intermediate-level topic.  (Some readers of this tutorial may already
be using RStudio or an external editor, and the treatment here will
include special instructions for them when needed.)

    - Coverage is mainly limited to base R. So for instance the popular
      but self-described "opinionated" Tidyverse is not treated at first, 
      partly due to its controversial nature (I am a [skeptic](http://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic)), 
      but again mainly because it would be an obstacle to your 
      becoming productive in R quickly.  A later lesson to be added will 
      introduce Tidy (defined as **dplyr** and pipes) and compare it to base-R.

      While you can learn a few simple things in Tidy quickly, thinking
      you are learning a lot, those things are quite limited in scope,
      and Tidy learners often find difficulty in applying R to real
      world data.  <span style="color: #b4637a;"> Our tutorial here is aimed
      at learners whose goal is to USE the R system productively in
      their own data analysis.  </span>  

* **Nonpassive approach:**  Passive learning, just watching the screen, is NO
learning.  There will be occasional **Your Turn** sections, in which you the 
learner must devise and try your own variants on what has been presented.
Sometimes the tutorial will be give you some suggestions, but even then,
you should cook up your own variants to try.  <span style="color: #b4637a;"> 
Remember:  You get out what you put in!</span>  The more actively you
work the **Your Turn** sections, the more powerful you will be as an R
coder.
