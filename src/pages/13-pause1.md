## <a name="pause1"> </a> Lesson 13:  Pause to Reflect

<span style="color: #b4637a;">Tip:</span>
Repeating an earlier point:
How does one build a house?  There of course is no set formula.  One has
various tools and materials, and the goal is to put these together in a
creative way to produce the end result, the house.

It's the same with R.  The tools here are the various functions, e.g.
`mean` and `which`, and the materials are one's data.  One then must
creatively put them together to achieve one's goal, say ferreting out
patterns in ridership in a public transportation system.  Again, it is a
creative process; there is no formula for anything.  But that is what
makes it fun, like solving a puzzle.

And...we can combine various functions in order to build *our own*
functions.  This will come in future lessons.
